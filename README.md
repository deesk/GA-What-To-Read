## Conclusion
This is my first app in React which helped me to understand basics such components, this, state and props.
I tried to used axios to make ajax request but failed, so used jQuery even though it is not recommended because there is no point of using another DOM manipulation library (especially which is big and bloated) when React itself is very good on it.
But I am very happy at least I could pull up this amount of work within three days with zero understanding beforehand besides few lectures in class.
