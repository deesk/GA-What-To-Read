## Conclusion
This is my first React application and found very challenging even to make a simple application. Especially got very confused with 'This' and initially with state and props.
I tried to used axios to make ajax request but failed, so used good old jQuery even though it is not recommended in React as no point of using another DOM manipulation library (especially which is big and bloated) as React it self is very good on it.
But i am very happy at least I could pull up this amount of work within three days where beforehand I didn't have much idea on React beside few lectures in class.
